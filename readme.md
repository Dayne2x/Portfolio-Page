Here is my personal portfolio page. It represents the summation of my knowledge gained from studying web development. It features several sections, such as a animated welcome landing, about,
technologies, projects and contact. The projects section features segments linking to the projects that I did over the course of my studying.

## My process

I've started out writing the basic HTML for the sections, then moving on to CSS and then implementing JavaScript functionality.

### Built with:

### What I learned

As always, when starting out a project a myriad bugs and difficulities occured when trying to fit all the components together but I think that in the end, it came together suffeciently competent. 

### Continued development

After taking a break from studying I aim to refresh my skills a bit the continue on improving my skills by learning a new framework.
